                    Francis Ford Coppola's legendary continuation and sequel to his landmark 1972 film, The_Godfather parallels the young Vito
                    Corleone's rise with his son Michael's spiritual fall, deepening The_Godfather's depiction of the dark
                    side of the American dream. In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America
                    after the local Mafia kills his family. Vito struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his
                    wife and growing brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci after he demands his customary
                    cut of the tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows.

                    would one day be completely legitimate.
